.SH DESCRIPTION
.BI convertz
is a simple tool that will convert your VM image to a Live Image for Zoni.
It accepts any VM image formats such as raw, vdi, qcow, etc.
(generally formats supported by qemu-img), converts it to raw format and
make all necessary adjustments before converting it a squashfs image. It
also obtains other information of the image such as the Linux Kernel
(vmlinuz) and initial ramdisk (initrd.img) before making necessary steps
to register the information into Zoni and move the necessary files to their
respective folders.
.PP
Currently
.BI convertz
only supports full Ubuntu or Debian based VM images (with vmlinuz and initrd.img in
/boot folder) and it assumes that the VM images file system in Non LVM
based and only contains a / or root partition and a swap partition.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-i input VM image"
The input is the actual VM image that a user wants to convert to live image.
.IP "-n live image name"
This is the live image name that will be register into Zoni as well as the 
name that the converted live image be named (with a .squashfs extension).
.IP "-u"
Use this option to update existing Image.
.IP "-p partition number"
This is the partition number of the / or root of the VM image. This parameter
is optional as
.BI convertz
will try to detect the partition itself. It is usefull only if the VM image
has more than 2 partitions during creation of the VM image.
.IP -h
Print usage/help information and exit.
.IP -v
Print version and exit.
.SH FILES
.I convertz
depends on several other tools in order to perform its task. They are:
.RS
zoni, qemu-img, parted, mksquashfs and uuidgen.
.RE
.PP
In addition, it expects the Debian Live Project deb files are compiled
and prepared. They are:
.RS
live-boot, live-config and live-tools
.RE
Information on preparing these files are available at http://live.debian.net
.SH BUGS
This is still a work in progress. As mentioned earlier,
.BI convertz
only supports Ubuntu or Debian based VM images only. A fair amount of steps had been
added to try to capture any errors as early as possible, any bugs please
contact the author. Thanks.
