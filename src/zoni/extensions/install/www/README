The files in here are to demo using zoni (with some additional
changes/extensions) to support direct OS provisioning into local disk
as suppose to using live images that zoni is doing now.

The files bootnode.py, getnpass.py, kickstart and preseed are to be
copied to /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ assuming we are dealing with Apache 
running in Ubuntu. The preseed and kickstart as just samples and would
need to be tweaked.

It is also necessary that a proper Ubuntu and/or CentOS repositor is
setup and served via Apache as the preseed and kickstart are setup
to install the OS via HTTP.
