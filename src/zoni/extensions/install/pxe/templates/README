Files in this folder serve as template for an alternative way of using zoni
to provision OS into local disk instead of booting of live images.

They are used in conjuction with several additional functions added by MIMOS to
support OS provisioning and should be if possible copy to
/var/lib/tfpboot/templates folder or if this is changed then you need to change
the CUSTOM_TEMPLATES_DIR in the ZoniDefaults.cfg file.
