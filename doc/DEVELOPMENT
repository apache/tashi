Current goals:
   * Add more hardware support for Zoni.
   * Add virtual hardware to Zoni to allow users to
      add support for their own hardware?

Future goals:
   * Consider using libraries like libcloud to abstract VMM interactions.

Other ideas:
   * Make available a console aggregator for user's VMs.

Python caveats:
   * We've liked to use variables like bin, id, sum, input, etc. are
     built-in, and will be flagged by pydev
   * pydev does not like python modules with a dash in the name
