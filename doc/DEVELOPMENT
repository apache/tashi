Current goals:
   * integrate bug fixes from Tashi sites into SVN.
   * Tashi is working well for us developers, so we should fork
     a stable version as beta release. Xen startup was problematic
     as of September, so advise on caveats there. Probably not include
     Zoni for now.

Future goals:
   * How should Tashi accounting be done? Database entries or
     flat files?
   * Support host auto-registration, but only by affirmative option.
   * Consider using libraries like libcloud to abstract VMM interactions.
   * Add more hardware support for Zoni.

Other ideas:
   * Make available a console aggregator for user's VMs.
