The Tashi project aims to build a software infrastructure for 
cloud computing on massive internet-scale datasets (what we call 
Big Data). The idea is to build a cluster management system 
that enables the Big Data that are stored in a cluster/data center 
to be accessed, shared, manipulated, and computed on by remote users 
in a convenient, efficient, and safe manner.
